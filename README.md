  Overview
</h2>

 ▪️  Circuit Crafting is a VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) design project that provides a collection of RTL (Register Transfer Level) code for various digital 
       circuits.The goal of this project is to design, simulate, and validate essential digital building blocks using Verilog for VLSI applications.
<br>
</br>
 ▪️ This repository includes several digital circuit designs, including multiplexers, demultiplexers, adders, and more. Each circuit is accompanied by testbenches to simulate its functionality and ensure correctness before moving to the physical implementation in VLSI design tools.
